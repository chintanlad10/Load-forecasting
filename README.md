# Load Forecasting for Green Field Cities

## 🏙️ Energy Grid Optimization for Smart Urban Development

This project implements a machine learning-driven approach for electricity load forecasting specifically designed for green field cities like GIFT City, Gujarat. The solution helps optimize energy grid development and infrastructure planning for smart urban environments.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Green field cities face unique challenges in energy grid development due to:
- Lack of historical consumption data
- Rapid infrastructure development
- Smart city features affecting traditional consumption patterns
- Need for optimal resource allocation

Our ML-based solution addresses these challenges by leveraging regional data patterns and specialized feature engineering.
